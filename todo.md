# TODO List

- [ ] Allow for ability to select which slot you're equipping to when there are multiple slots available for a piece of equipment
- [ ] Equip / use by item ID rather than index
- [ ] Better equipment view, and make list have constant ordering, rather than displaying in any order
- [ ] Alongside that, use proper labels rather than stuff like "right_hand"
- [ ] Enemies have inventory, and drop items on death
- [ ] Pick up only one item at a time when picking things up
- [ ] Show list of items under the player
- [ ] Hover display item info on keypress maybe?
- [ ] MP and Magic? Spell system?
- [ ] With that, a way to target specific enemies within range
- [ ] Special spells, like maybe one that spawns items or enemies
